# benny

benny gives you two automation runners for slack issue reports. one triages each report. the other reproduces confirmed bugs and may prepare a small draft fix. on claude code they run as github actions workflows that invoke claude code headlessly.

the files in this directory are dormant setup and automation sources. they do not appear as slash skills.

## set it up

1. point claude code at [`FOR_AGENTS.md`](./FOR_AGENTS.md) and name the target repository.
2. let setup merge this whole directory into the target at `.github/benny/`. it must preserve destination-only files and review conflicts instead of overwriting local edits.
3. let setup enable pstack in the target repository's `.claude/settings.json` for shared dependencies:

```json
{
	"plugins": {
		"pstack": { "enabled": true }
	}
}
```

4. keep user-owned configuration outside the copied pack, for example in `.claude/benny/`. adapt [`configuration.example.yaml`](./templates/configuration.example.yaml) and [`feature-map.example.md`](./skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/feature-map.example.md).
5. commit `.claude/settings.json`, `.github/benny/`, and any secret-free configuration before enabling either automation.
6. review each new automation draft or update existing automations in their editors. then send a harmless test report and verify every source-channel post stays in the original thread.
